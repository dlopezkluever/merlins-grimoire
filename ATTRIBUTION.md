## Original Base Game

This project, "Merlin's Grimoire: Chemistry Edition," is built upon an open-source dungeon crawler game. We acknowledge and thank the original creators for providing the foundation that made this educational adaptation possible.

### Original Game Features Retained

The following core systems from the original game have been retained and adapted:
- Procedural dungeon generation system (3x3 room layout)
- Core movement mechanics (WASD 8-directional movement)
- Enemy AI and pathfinding systems
- Collision detection and physics
- Room transition and door mechanics
- Base sprite rendering system

### Modifications and Additions

While maintaining the core gameplay mechanics, we have made significant modifications to create an educational experience:
- Replaced weapon system with spell-casting mechanics
- Added potion crafting system with chemistry problem integration
- Implemented educational content delivery system
- Created new UI/UX following medieval wizard theme
- Integrated Supabase backend for progress tracking
- Added Socket.IO support for multiplayer functionality
- Redesigned all visual assets to match our theme

### License Compliance

This project complies with the original game's open-source license by:
- Maintaining this attribution file
- Preserving the open-source nature of the codebase
- Acknowledging the original creators' contribution

### Educational Purpose

This adaptation was created for educational purposes, specifically to make chemistry learning more engaging through gamification. The project aims to help students from high school to college level improve their chemistry knowledge through interactive gameplay.
