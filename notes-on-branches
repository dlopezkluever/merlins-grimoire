as of 8.8.2025:

I thought our most complete project was found in multiplayer-broke-same-world (current)
So I saved our old, only single player, no main menu having and kinda buggy main as  old-version/only-single-player
And then I overwrote main to have it be exactly like multiplayer-broke-same-world.. thus main is now ready to go.

however, multiplayer-seperate-worlds has potential, and could be worth putting in it's own github, as the differences are too significant to merge
but it could also be worht referencing, espeically if we decide to go with different worlds (dif maps) for multiplayer
