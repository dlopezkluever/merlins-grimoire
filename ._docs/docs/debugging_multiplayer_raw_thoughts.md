All right, it seems like a lot of these bugs are not improved by your latest attempt. To clarify, still, Player 2 cannot cause the enemies to appear when he enters a room by himself. There's still small zoomed out objects randomly appearing, overlaying the screen for both Player 1 and Player 2, as though they're being generated twice. When it should be one map with one zoomed out. You know, sorry, there should be one map with the two players in it where they both can have the same functionalities that they have in the solo game, including spawning enemies, breaking barrels, being able to collect items, and Player 2 cannot do those things. Though he can break barrels, he can't do really anything else. He can't open the treasure still. Additionally, he only takes harm from enemies when he purposely bumps into them, but not when they fire at him, showcasing again a lack of connection for the second player in the map. Additionally, the pop-up model for "Die Journey Hath Ended" appears when either player dies but does not disappear once they respawn. It should only be on screen for about three seconds before disappearing. For Player 2, we actually see two pop-up models. One that's quite zoomed in, not even fitting on the screen. We don't see a health bar for either character when this should be present on screen. I think for simplicity's sake this should just be put at the bottom of their window, recognizing that it's split screen. Which is fine. Forget trying to make the page 1600x600. Just leave it in the way it is, 800 by 600, where the screen splits so that both players have a 400 by 600 screen, one on the right, one on the left. That's fine. We should have the health bar thus in the middle of each of these screens. You should be using the same logic you did to place the Help bar for the solo player, do that same thing for each of these two players. Oh, that's good. To revert the changes that we've attempted that have failed and try it again, being able to feed your chat, Cursor's chat, with the context of what didn't work and what does work. Or could we just apply these fixes on top of all the erroneous fixes we've attempted? My feeling is that the former will probably be better as we would have cleaner code, but you will understand the code base better than I would. So I need you to make a judgment on that. But first, let's focus on debugging. Could we use console logs? Could we use different methods of testing this that are quicker? And that can help us understand the source of the problem, which is a clear, like there's a fundamental issue happening that's causing all these weird bugs.
