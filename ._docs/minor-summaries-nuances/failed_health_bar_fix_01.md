We are trying to simply get the User Health Bar in the top left corner for the user character. You’ve tried a couple times and failed.  



Here is one of your failed attempts at fixing our issue: “”


**USER**
I still can't see the player's health bar in the bottom right corner of the room, and the map continues to not be placed right, like again only a tiny sliver of that map is on the screen, like it just looks mis placed. Did you try what @debugging_guide_post_revert.md said to do? (## **What Was Actually Working Before:**


- **Health bar** may have been positioned correctly using a different coordinate system
- **MiniMap** was probably working with the correct positioning

## **The Root Problem:**

The fundamental issue is **coordinate system confusion**:
- `camera.width/height` = 800x600 (game's internal resolution)
- Actual display size = browser window size (responsive))

**CURSOR**:

You're absolutely right! I made the same mistake again - I used `this.scene.scale.gameSize.width/height` which is still the wrong coordinate system. According to the debugging guide, the issue is that I'm using the game's internal resolution (800x600) instead of the actual browser window size.

Let me check what coordinate system was working before and fix this properly:

I can see the issue! Looking at the code, I can see that UI elements that work correctly (like game over/victory screens) use `camera.width` and `camera.height`, but with scroll offsets. The issue is that I'm using `scene.scale.gameSize` which is the internal game resolution (800x600), not the actual display size.

Let me check what coordinate system the working UI elements use:
Read file: src/scenes/MainScene.ts
Perfect! The working UI uses `this.cameras.main.width` and `this.cameras.main.height` but also accounts for the camera scroll position. For fixed UI elements, I need to use the camera dimensions. Let me fix both the health bar and mini-map:
      // Position the player health bar in the bottom right corner with padding
      // Use the actual game display size, not camera dimensions
      this.bar.setScrollFactor(0); // This makes it stay fixed on screen
      
      // Get the actual display size from the scale manager
      const gameWidth = this.scene.scale.gameSize.width;
      const gameHeight = this.scene.scale.gameSize.height;
      
      // Position in bottom-right corner
      const x = gameWidth - this.width - this.padding;
      const y = gameHeight - this.height - this.padding;
      this.bar.setPosition(x, y);

->

      // Position the player health bar in the bottom right corner with padding
      // Use camera dimensions (the actual viewport size)
      this.bar.setScrollFactor(0); // This makes it stay fixed on screen
      
      // Get camera dimensions and scroll position for correct positioning
      const camera = this.scene.cameras.main;
      const x = camera.scrollX + camera.width - this.width - this.padding;
      const y = camera.scrollY + camera.height - this.height - this.padding;
      this.bar.setPosition(x, y);


       // Position text above the health bar
